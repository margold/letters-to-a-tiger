Dear Tiger,

Today I got a couple (audio)books on the region to motivate my explorations. I was looking up things that the audiobook mentions in passing, so today I learned
- that Spain consists of autonomous regions, and the history of how it came about (I previously was only vaguely aware that it may have contained some autonomous regions)
- about caravel ships and triangular-shaped sails
- about the city of Ceuta
- about Andorra
- that "moor" referred specifically to Muslims from North Africa, and both white and black, not North Africans or Africans in general. I was confused by the German word "Mohr" (in addition to "Maur", which is the actual translation) which used to refer to any dark-skinned person.

Reading further on the conquistadors: I'm sure I read about it in "Guns, Germs, and Steel" before but it wasn't fresh in my mind, namely that the titular germs (European, but also, in an unlucky coincidence, indigenous ones) killed an estimated 90-95% of the population of the Americas, many ahead of the Spanish and Portuguese because germs travel faster.

The book also mentioned how Portugal ended up getting Brazil: prior to Columbus' voyage, the king appears to have had some intelligence about the true circumference of the earth and that there well could be something other than the Indies to the West, so when the borders of areas of influence in the Atlantic were drawn up between Portugal and Spain, he fought to shift them more westwards than originally planned.

And how the Portuguese, during the first contact with the ruler of one of the kingdoms in India, were convinced he was Christian, and the many arms were just their way to portray saints. And how a Dutch sailor wrote a bestseller on travels to far-away lands (complete with descriptions of sexual depravities of Goan women), giving away a great amount of Portuguese state secrets in the process.

The book kept mentioning the Dutch having herring as a profitable export, and I didn't understand why until it got to Catholic diet restrictions and poor weather in Northern Europe.

Economy is built on the unlikeliest of things!

Same goes for olive oil exports to Western and Northern Europe, who didn't have substitutes for animal fats themselves (Catholic diet restrictions again). Portugal apparently was making a good profit on those.

This all changes with the Reformation.

Btw, fun fact: the mythical Christian king in the East Prester John, search for whom was partially propelling the Age of Discovery, is also a Marvel comic book character ("most often a villain opposing Thor and Deadpool").
And: the Portuguese introduced chili pepper to India, and from there to the rest of Asia! There was no hot chili pepper anywhere in Asia before 15-16th century! (They call it "piri-piri" here, which is apparently a Swahili word. And here I thought it was a typical Japanese onomatopoeia thing!)

That entire bit of political maneuvering with this split between Spain and Portugal is interesting... They had some intelligence about what may have been out there and were trying to act on it, a challenging and fascinating thing... Maybe I'll find a book on the politics of the time.

Your Kitty.
