Dear Tiger,

I was reading Cavafy, and that made me look up Alexandria. [This article](http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/12/23/lighthouse-dims-egypt-alexandria-salafists-mubarak-sisi-longform/) is long but really good. Or read [this poem twin-set](http://www.leonardcohensite.com/10newsongs/alexandra_leaving.htm) for a shorter treatment, and [this etching by David Hockney](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/8GFWaETATL6p2d16CYIqBw) for a different topic in Cavafy's work.

Your Kitty
